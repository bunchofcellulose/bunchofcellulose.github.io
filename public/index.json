You might be wondering why I made this site. The short answer is, to have a place to put my thoughts and showcase my work. I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing about various topics, mainly programming, math, physics, astronomy, and other things that interest me. I hope you find something useful here.\nWho are you? # Good question! My name is Akshat Srivastava, from Gurugram, India, and I am currently a high school student in my senior year. I have a passion for physics and astronomy. I aim to pursue a career in physics or astronomy in the future.\nI also enjoy programming in my free time. I primarily use Rust for most of my projects. I also enjoy solving math problems, studying about renewable technologies, and learning new stuff in general. I also have an interest in linguistics and data science.\nI enjoy reading books. My favourite book is the \u0026ldquo;The Stranger\u0026rdquo; by Albert Camus. Sadly, I don\u0026rsquo;t find as much time to read as I would like anymore.\nWhere can I find you? # If you want to contact me, you can either reach me out via email at bunchofcellulose@gmail.com, or Linkedin.
