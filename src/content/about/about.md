title: "About Me"
---

I'm currently in my final year of senior secondary schooling, hoping to embark my journey into physics and linguistics in the coming months.

I enjoy solving physics and math problems, especially those that challenge my understanding and push me to think beyond what I know. My other interests include studying linguistics, programming, reading literature, playing chess, and exploring new technologies.

I have a reputation of coming up with the most out-of-the-universe dad jokes, so beware!
