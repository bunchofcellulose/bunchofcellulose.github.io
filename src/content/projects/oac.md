## Vision & Impact

The OAC was created to address a gap in international astronomy competition opportunities. By providing a free, online, globally-accessible competition with high-quality problems written by accomplished young astronomers, OAC aims to:

- Inspire the next generation of astronomers and physicists
- Provide equal opportunity regardless of geographic or economic background
- Create a supportive community of astronomy enthusiasts
- Demonstrate that excellence in astronomy education can be accessible to everyone

The competition embodies the principle that talent and passion for astronomy should be the only barriers to participation, not cost, location, or institutional constraints.
