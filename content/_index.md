Welcome! You might be wondering why I made this site. The short answer is, to have a place to put my thoughts and showcase my work. I'll be writing about various topics, mainly programming, math, physics, astronomy, and other things that interest me. I hope you find something useful here.

## Who are you?

Good question! My name is Akshat Srivastava, from Gurugram, India, and I am currently a high school student in my senior year. I have a passion for physics and astronomy. I aim to pursue a career in physics or astronomy in the future.

I also enjoy programming in my free time. I primarily use Rust for most of my projects. I also enjoy solving math problems, studying about renewable technologies, and learning new stuff in general. I also have an interest in linguistics and data science.

I enjoy reading books. My favourite book is the "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Sadly, I don't find as much time to read as I would like anymore.

## Where can I find you?

If you want to contact me, you can either reach me out via email at [bunchofcellulose@gmail.com](mailto:bunchofcellulose@gmail.com), or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iam-akshat-srivastava/). You can also reach out on [discord](https://discord.gg/bV8bxvTmzU).
