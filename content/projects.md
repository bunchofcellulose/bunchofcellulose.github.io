Here are some of the notable projects and contributions that I have made so far.

## Research

I participated in CERN's Beamline for Schools 2025 competition, where I worked on a proposal for the investigation of radiation effects from cosmic particles on space-based electronics. [Paper](../assets/bl4s.pdf)

I carried out independent research on the shifts in position and number of Lagrange points in the N+1 body problem under Yukawa-type potentials. [Paper](../assets/N_1_maxwell_ring.pdf)

## AO Guide

[AO Guide](https://aoguide.app) is the a free, online, and comprehensive guide to mastery of Astronomy Olympiads. It provides students with a structured curriculum, practice problems, and resources to excel in Astronomy Olympiads.

## Celestial Sphere

[Celestial Sphere](https://bunchofcellulose.github.io/celestialsphere/) is a web application that provides a neat and user-friendly interface for drawing and visualizing diagrams on a sphere. This provides a tool for students and educators to easily learn and engage with spherical diagrams, which are commonly used in spherical astronomy.

All of the code is open source and available on GitHub.

## SmolOS

An operating system written completely from scratch in Rust, which can run on bare metal. It doesn't have much, but try to find some of the easter eggs hidden in it!
