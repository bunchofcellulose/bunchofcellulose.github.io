Here are some of the notable projects and contributions that I have made so far.

## Celestial Sphere

Celestial Sphere is a web application that provides a neat and user-friendly interface for drawing and visualizing diagrams on a sphere. This provides a tool for students and educators to easily learn and engage with spherical diagrams, which are commonly used in spherical astronomy.

All of the code is open source and available on GitHub.

## SmolOS

An operating system written completely from scratch in Rust, which can run on bare metal. It doesn't have much, but try to find some of the easter eggs hidden in it!
